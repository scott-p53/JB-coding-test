# What Projects Interest Me
## giter8 templates integration
Having worked with git since my first semester at school I'd be very interested in working on a tool 
that would further expand my understanding of git and improve upon my skills to write  clean 
web APIs. I'd also be very interest to work on this because of my interest when it comes to parsing
and analyzing structured documents which I gained while working on compilers and JSON parsers at school.

## Standalone IntelliJ inspections
While I don't very much knowledge about sbt besides using it to build some very simple projects I'd
be very interested in working a a tool that allowed for code inspection in CI tools. Having worked with
TeamCity during my previous internship I'm interested in improving developer efficiency and code quality
by creating a tool to run stand alone inspection for CI tools.

## Dependency completion and discovery
Dependency discovery and management can be some of the biggest pain points for developers. Having had
many issues where upgrading and finding dependencies broke my work environment while at my internship and on
school projects and spending hours trying to manually re-add the correct dependencies I'm very interested
in work that allows for automation of this task.
